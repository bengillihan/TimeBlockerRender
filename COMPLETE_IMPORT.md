# Complete Your Supabase Import

## Current Status
Your basic data imported successfully, but tasks and todos are missing. Here's how to complete the import:

## Step 1: Import Missing Data

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor → New Query
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents from `add_tasks_todos.sql`
3. **Click Run** - this will add your 29 tasks and 18 todos
4. **Verify results** - you should see task and todo counts in the output

## Step 2: Verify Complete Import

After running the script, you should see:
- **29 tasks** including Bible Study, Exercise, Work tasks, APS projects
- **18 todos** including QuickBase SSO, PowerBI development, LinkedIn posts
- **All data linked** to your user account properly

## Step 3: Test Your Application

Once tasks and todos are imported:
1. Your TimeBlocker app will have all original data
2. Tasks will appear in the task management section  
3. Todos will show in your todo lists
4. Time blocking will work with your actual tasks
