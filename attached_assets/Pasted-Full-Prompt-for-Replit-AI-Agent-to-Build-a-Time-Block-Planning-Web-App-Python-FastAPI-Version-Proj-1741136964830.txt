Full Prompt for Replit AI Agent to Build a Time Block Planning Web App (Python FastAPI Version)
Project: Time Block Planning Web App
Objective:
Develop a time-blocking web application with Google Authentication, allowing users to plan, track, and review their daily schedules efficiently.

Each user will have private, personalized data including:

Top 5 Priorities for the day.
15-minute time blocks from 6:00 AM - 5:00 PM.
A "Brain Dump" section for freeform notes.
A history log to review and edit past days.
A daily productivity rating (1-5 scale).
Key Features & Functionality
1️⃣ User Authentication & Setup (Google Auth)
✅ Users log in with Google OAuth.
✅ Each user has a unique account and private data.
✅ User’s tasks, schedules, and history are stored in PostgreSQL (or Firestore).

2️⃣ Task & Schedule Management
✅ Users can list their Top 5 Priorities for the day.
✅ A Brain Dump section allows users to jot down notes.
✅ Users can schedule tasks into 15-minute increments (6 AM - 5 PM).
✅ Drag & Drop functionality for task scheduling.
✅ Completed tasks are visually marked.
✅ Unfinished tasks automatically roll over to the next day.

3️⃣ Daily Planning UI
✅ Auto-populated date at the top of the page.
✅ Time-blocking grid (6:00 AM - 5:00 PM, in 15-minute increments).
✅ Dedicated input fields for:

Top 5 Priorities
Brain Dump/Notes ✅ Smooth drag-and-drop task scheduling.
✅ Task rollover automation for unfinished tasks.
4️⃣ End-of-Day Review & History Tracking
✅ Users rate their daily productivity (1-5 scale).
✅ Users leave final notes or reflections for each day.
✅ Navigation to previous days via:

⬅️➡️ Left/right arrows to go back/forward one day.
📅 Calendar picker to select a past date.
✅ Past days remain editable for later reflection.
5️⃣ Data Storage & Security
✅ Each user's data is private and stored in PostgreSQL with FastAPI ORM (SQLAlchemy).
✅ Local storage fallback for offline use, with auto-sync when online.
✅ Cloud sync ensures data is available across devices.

🔧 Tech Stack Recommendations (Python FastAPI Version)
Front-End:
React.js (or Next.js for better performance)
