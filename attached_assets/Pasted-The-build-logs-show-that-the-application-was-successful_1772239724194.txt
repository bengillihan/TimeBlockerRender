The build logs show that the application was successfully built, but if it’s "not loading" (likely a "Bad Gateway" or "Application Error"), the problem is happening at runtime.

Based on your current configuration and common Railway deployment hurdles, here is a checklist to get it back up:

1. Fix the Database URL Schema
Railway often provides a DATABASE_URL starting with postgres://. However, SQLAlchemy 1.4+ and 2.0 require it to be postgresql://.

In your config.py or where you initialize the database, ensure you have this logic:

Python
import os

uri = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
if uri and uri.startswith("postgres://"):
    uri = uri.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)

app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = uri
2. Verify Your Environment Variables
The application will crash immediately if required secrets are missing. Ensure these are set in your Railway Variables tab:

DATABASE_URL (Should be automatically linked if you have a Postgres service).

SECRET_KEY (Any long random string).

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (Required for your auth flow).

APP_URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.up.railway.app).

3. Simplify Gunicorn Workers
Your log shows --workers 1. For the Railway free tier, this is perfect. However, if your application is doing heavy work (like that 180-day summary) on startup, it might hit the timeout.

In your Railway dashboard, check the Deploy Logs. If you see "Worker Timeout," increase the timeout variable:

Set a variable: GUNICORN_TIMEOUT=120

4. Check the Entry Point
The start command is looking for app:app. This assumes you have a file named app.py and inside it, a variable named app = Flask(__name__).

If your Flask object is created inside a function (factory pattern), you need to change the start command to app:create_app() or similar.

If your main file is named main.py, the command should be main:app.

5. Debugging "Not Loading"
To see the exact error, check the Deploy Logs in the Railway dashboard.

If you see psycopg2.OperationalError: The app can't talk to the database. Check your DATABASE_URL.

If you see ImportError: A dependency is missing from requirements.txt.

If you see nothing: The app might be bound to the wrong port. Double-check that your code isn't hardcoding app.run(port=5000). Gunicorn handles the port via the $PORT environment variable automatically.
