# June Data Export and Import Guide

This guide will help you export your June 2025 data from Replit and import it into your Railway + Supabase deployment.

## Step 1: Export from Replit

### Export Daily Plans
```sql
-- Export June daily plans
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    date,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM daily_plans 
WHERE date >= '2025-06-01' AND date <= '2025-06-30'
ORDER BY date;
```

### Export Priorities
```sql
-- Export June priorities
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.daily_plan_id,
    p.content,
    p.order,
    p.completed,
    p.created_at,
    p.updated_at,
    dp.date
FROM priorities p
JOIN daily_plans dp ON p.daily_plan_id = dp.id
WHERE dp.date >= '2025-06-01' AND dp.date <= '2025-06-30'
ORDER BY dp.date, p.order;
```

### Export Time Blocks
```sql
-- Export June time blocks
SELECT 
    tb.id,
    tb.daily_plan_id,
    tb.start_time,
    tb.end_time,
    tb.task_id,
    tb.completed,
    tb.notes,
    tb.created_at,
    tb.updated_at,
    dp.date
FROM time_blocks tb
JOIN daily_plans dp ON tb.daily_plan_id = dp.id
WHERE dp.date >= '2025-06-01' AND dp.date <= '2025-06-30'
ORDER BY dp.date, tb.start_time;
```

## Step 2: Import to Supabase

1. Copy the SQL results from each export
2. Run the INSERT statements in your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Verify the import with:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM daily_plans WHERE date >= '2025-06-01';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM priorities p JOIN daily_plans dp ON p.daily_plan_id = dp.id WHERE dp.date >= '2025-06-01';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM time_blocks tb JOIN daily_plans dp ON tb.daily_plan_id = dp.id WHERE dp.date >= '2025-06-01';
   ```

After import, check your TimeBlocker at your Railway deployment URL to see your June data restored.

## Alternative: Direct Database Export

If you have direct database access:

```sql
# Export specific June data
pg_dump -h your-db-host -U your-username -d your-database --data-only --table=daily_plans --table=priorities --table=time_blocks --where="date >= '2025-06-01' AND date <= '2025-06-30'" > june_data.sql
```
