Perfect! I've successfully cleaned up your project by removing all Render references and focusing on Railway + Supabase deployment. Here's a summary of what I've done:
Files Removed (Render-specific):
render.yaml
render_requirements.txt
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
LOGIN_FIX.md
PRODUCTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
Files Updated (Removed Render references):
JUNE_EXPORT_GUIDE.md - Updated to focus on Railway deployment
SUPABASE_IMPORT_GUIDE.md - Removed Render deployment steps
replit.md - Completely rewritten to focus on Railway migration
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md - Updated to focus on Railway issues
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md - Streamlined for Railway deployment
New Files Created:
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive Railway deployment guide
railway_diagnostic.py - Diagnostic script to verify Railway configuration
Key Improvements Made:
1. Simplified Railway Configuration
Updated Procfile with optimized Gunicorn settings for Railway free tier
Simplified railway_start.py to essential checks only
Enhanced railway.json with better health check configuration
Optimized health check endpoint in app.py
2. Railway-Optimized Settings
Single Worker: Prevents resource conflicts on Railway free tier
Dynamic Port Binding: Uses Railway's $PORT environment variable
Fast Health Check: Optimized for Railway's monitoring system
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Deployment Reliability
Health Check: /health endpoint for Railway monitoring
Auto-restart: Configured to restart on failures
Environment Validation: Checks for required environment variables
Backup Startup: Multiple startup options for reliability
What You Need to Know About Your Railway Setup:
Required Environment Variables:
Apply
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
Railway Configuration:
Health Check Path: /health
Health Check Timeout: 30 seconds
Restart Policy: On Failure (max 3 retries)
Start Command: Uses Gunicorn with Railway-optimized settings
Next Steps:
Run the diagnostic script to verify your configuration:
Apply
Run
   python railway_diagnostic.py
Commit and push your changes:
Apply
Run
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clean up Render references, optimize for Railway deployment"
   git push
Deploy to Railway - Railway will automatically deploy with the new configuration
Monitor deployment - Check Railway logs and verify the health endpoint
The simplified configuration should resolve your 502 errors and provide a much more reliable Railway deployment. The focus is now entirely on Railway + Supabase, which should eliminate the confusion and deployment issues you were experiencing.
