Database: Configured for PostgreSQL via Supabase
Configuration: Environment-based configuration management
Dependencies: Standardized requirements.txt for Render
Deployment: Render-specific configuration and deployment guide
Next Steps:
Set up Supabase: Create a project and run the migration SQL
Update Google OAuth: Add your Render domain to redirect URIs
Deploy to Render: Follow the deployment guide
Test thoroughly: Verify all features work correctly
